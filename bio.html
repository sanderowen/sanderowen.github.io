    Sander Owen is a Norwegian drummer and music producer living in El Paso, Texas, USA.
    </p></br>
    
    <p>

    Sander grew up in a very musical family in Skien, Norway. His mother taught him piano, guitar, and singing; she also introduced him to many of his lifelong favorite artists—The Police, Ray Charles, Pat Metheny. He started playing the drums at age five, because no one else wanted to be the drummer in his older brother's Kiss cover band. When his younger <a href="http://mariannehalmrast.com" class="link" target="blank">sister</a> picked up the bass, the family trio was complete. One of their neighbors took Sander under his wings and showed him the basics.
    Sander quickly fell in love with the instrument, and started learning from the best&mdash;Omar Hakim, Manu Katche, Jeff Porcaro, Dennis Chambers, Peter Erskine, Phil Collins, Paolo Vinaccia, Stewart Copeland, Dave Weckl, Steve Gadd, Bernard Peardy, Jimmy Cobb, Billy Higgins, Tony Williams, Billy Cobham.

    <p> 
    At fifteen, he started doing professional work&mdash;jazz clubs, cruise ships (Hurtigruta), wedding bands, cover bands, church bands. Sander went on to study music at the SVG School, where he graduated with top grades, after studying under Audun Kleive (Terje Rypdal). Sander also had students of his own. He composed and arranged music for theaters and revues as well. After graduation, he moved to Oslo and started working for his <a href="http://knuthalmrast.no" class="link" target="blank">uncle's</a> sound production company. Sander also had a small, but successful rehearsal studio business at the time. His band, Fibers, released several albums and singles.

   Eventually, he moved to Los Angeles, where he became a session drummer after getting some good advice from Kenny Aronoff (Smashing Pumkins, John Fogerty). After many years in LA, he decided to move someplace where he could afford to build his own studio. He concidered many cities, but decided on El Paso. He built the studio to spec&mdash;custom made to record nothing but drums. In the process, he was fortunate to get some tips from Stan Katayama (recording engineer from the Rage Against The Machine debut album), Jan Erik Kongshaug (engineer on the majority of  Pat Metheny's albums), as well as his other <a href="http://tor.halmrast.no" class="link" target="blank">uncle</a>, who is an acoustic engineer.
