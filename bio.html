Sander Owen grew up in a very musical family in Skien, Norway. His mother taught him piano, guitar, and singing; she also introduced him to many of his lifelong favorite artists—The Police, Ray Charles, Keith Jarrett. Sander started playing the drums at age five, because no one else wanted to be the drummer in his older brother's Kiss cover band. One of their neighbors took Sander under his wings and showed him the basics. Sander quickly fell in love with the instrument, and started learning from the best&mdash;Omar Hakim, Manu Katche, Jeff Porcaro, Dennis Chambers, Peter Erskine, Phil Collins, Stewart Copeland, Dave Weckl, Steve Gadd, Bernard Peardy, Jimmy Cobb, Billy Higgins, Tony Williams, Billy Cobham. When his younger sister picked up the bass, the family trio was complete.

<p> 
At fifteen, he started doing professional work&mdash;jazz clubs, cruise ships (Hurtigruta), wedding bands, cover bands, church bands. Sander went on to study music at the SVG School, where he graduated with top grades in drums. He also had many students. He composed and arranged music for theaters and revues as well.
<p></br>

<p>
After graduation, he moved to Oslo and started working for his uncle's sound production company. Sander produced music for The Red Cross, Keith Floyd (the famous TV chef), Gyldendal (the biggest book publisher in Norway), TV Norge, and Norsk Film. He also had a small, but successful rehearsal studio business. His band released several albums and singles too.
</p></br>
    
<p>
He eventually moved to Los Angeles USA, where he started picking up session work after getting some good advice from Kenny Aronoff (Smashing Pumpkins, John Fogerty). Sander recorded with Kevin Moore (Dream Theater), Chris Poland (Megadeth), Matt Malley  (Counting Crows), Ric Fierabracci (Chick Corea), Brett Garsed (Nelson), and Ben Mallare (Kelly Clarkson). He also warmed up for Machina (ex-Evanescence members); worked with Carson Slovak (Century); played with Hans Zermuehlen (Glenn Hughes); and performed at The Whisky a Go Go, The Baked Potato, Musician's Institute, and The SAE Institute.
</p></br>
   
<p>
After a few years, he decided to move to El Paso, Texas: a place where he could build his own studio. He was fortunate to get some tips from Stan Katayama (recording engineer from the Rage Against The Machine debut album), Jan Erik Kongshaug (engineer on the majority of  Pat Metheny's albums), as well as his other uncle, who is an acoustic engineer. The studio was custom built to record nothing but drums, and the equipment was top notch.</p></br>

<p>
When he didn't record for clients, he produced his own music: groove based instead of riff or melody based, which became his signature style.</p>
