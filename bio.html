    He has also produced music for The Red Cross, Keith Floyd (the famous TV chef), TV Norge, and Norsk Film. In Los Angeles, he has performed at The Whisky a Go Go, The Baked Potato, Musician's Institute, The SAE Institue, and more.
    </p></br>

    <p>
    He started playing the drums at age five, because no one else wanted to be the drummer in his older brother's Kiss cover band. One of their neighbors took Sander under his wings and showed him the basics.
    He quickly fell in love with the instrument, and started learning from the best&mdash;Omar Hakim, Manu Katche, Jeff Porcaro, Dennis Chambers, Peter Erskine, Stewart Copeland, Dave Weckl, Steve Gadd, Bernard Peardy, Jimmy Cobb, Billy Higgins, Tony Williams, Billy Cobham.
    </p></br>

    <p> 
    At fifteen, he started doing professional work&mdash;jazz clubs, cruise ships (Hurtigruta), wedding bands, cover bands, church bands. He went on to study music at the SVG School, where he graduated with top grades, after studying under Audun Kleive (Terje Rypdal). He also had students of his own. He composed and arranged music for theaters and revues as well.
    </p></br> 

    <p> 
    After graduation, he moved to Oslo and started working for Halmrast Sound Production. He also had a small, but successful rehearsal studio business at the time. His band, Fibers, released two albums and five singles.
    </p></br>

    <p>
    Eventually, he moved to Los Angeles, where he started out as a session drummer after getting some good advice from Kenny Aronoff (Smashing Pumkins, John Fogerty).
