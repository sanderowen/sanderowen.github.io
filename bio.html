Sander Owen grew up in Skien, Norway. He started playing the drums at age five, under the influence of drummers such as Omar Hakim, Manu Katche, Jeff Porcaro, Dennis Chambers, Peter Erskine, Phil Collins, Stewart Copeland, Dave Weckl, Steve Gadd, Bernard Peardy, Jimmy Cobb, Billy Higgins, Tony Williams, and Billy Cobham.
</p></br>

<p> 
At fifteen, he started doing professional work&mdash;jazz clubs, cruise ships (Hurtigruta), wedding bands, cover bands, church bands. He went on to study music at the SVG School, where he graduated with top grades in drums. He also had many students. He composed and arranged music for theaters and revues as well.
<p></br>

<p>
After graduation, he moved to Oslo. There, he produced music for The Red Cross, Keith Floyd (the famous TV chef), Gyldendal (the biggest book publisher in Norway), TV Norge, and Norsk Film. He also had a small, but successful rehearsal studio business. His band released several albums and singles too.
</p></br>
    
<p>
He eventually moved to Los Angeles USA, where he recorded with Kevin Moore (Dream Theater), Chris Poland (Megadeth), Matt Malley (Counting Crows), and Ric Fierabracci (Chick Corea). He also performed at The Whisky a Go Go, The Baked Potato, and The Musician's Institute.
</p></br>
   
<p>
After a few years, he decided to move to El Paso, Texas: a place where he could build his own studio. The studio was custom built to record nothing but drums, and the equipment was top notch.</p></br>

<p>
When he didn't record for clients, he produced his own music: groove based instead of riff or melody based, which became his signature style. He films the recording of his songs, and makes the music and videos available online.
