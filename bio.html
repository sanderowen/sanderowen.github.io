<p> 
Sander Owen grew up in Skien, Norway. He started playing the drums at age five. At fifteen, he began doing professional work&mdash;jazz clubs, cruise ships (Hurtigruta), wedding/cover/church bands. All though mostly self-taught, he did graduate from the SVG School&mdash;studying under Audun Kleive (Terje Rypdal)&mdash;with top grades in drums. He also had many students, and composed music for theater as well. 
</p></br>

<p>
After graduation, he moved to Oslo, where he produced music for The Red Cross, Keith Floyd (the famous TV chef), Gyldendal Publishing, TV Norge, and Norsk Film. He released three albums and several singles with his old band; and he had a small, but successful rehearsal studio business.
</p></br>
    
<p>
He eventually moved to Los Angeles, USA, where he recorded drums with Kevin Moore (Dream Theater), Chris Poland (Megadeth), Matt Malley (Counting Crows), Ric Fierabracci (Chick Corea), Brett Garsed (T.J. Helmerich), and Ben Mallare (Kelly Clarkson). He also performed at The Whisky a Go Go, The Musician's Institute, and The Baked Potato&mdash;all the while touring Greater Los Angeles with The Gravity Guild.
</p></br>
   
<p>
He ended up buying a house on the outskirts of El Paso, Texas, where he set up a recording studio. He also gigged other parts of the US during this period&mdash;Denver, Austin, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle, New York. Work dried up during the pandemic, however, that didn't deter him from pursuing his own music. He produced nine songs&mdash;with matching videos&mdash;during the lockdowns.
	</p></br>

<p>
When the travel restrictions lifted, he realized it was time to move back to Norway. He found Porsgrunn to be a good town to set up his studio.
